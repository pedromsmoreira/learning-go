To run the program, put the code in hello-world.go and use go run.
$ go run hello-world.go
hello world

Sometimes weâ€™ll want to build our programs into binaries. We can do this using go build.
$ go build hello-world.go
$ ls
hello-world	hello-world.go

We can then execute the built binary directly.
$ ./hello-world
hello world

Show execution time with go run
$ time go run src/worker-pools/worker-pools.go
